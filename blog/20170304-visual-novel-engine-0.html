  <h3>What is visual novel?</h3>
  <blockquote>
  A visual novel is an interactive game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels. Sound novels and kinetic novels are types of visual novels, although visual novels have its own distinction between the others.

  <h3>Why another engine?</h3>
  No specific reasons. Just for the sake of it.
  
  <h3>In what language will it use?</h3>
  <p><a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>, mostly because it's by far the only language that I feel comfortable to work with. There's a python one which is pretty popular so racket should also be able to do the trick, maybe the language itself is not designed for doing these things, though.</p>

  <h3>Will it use OpenGL?</h3>
  <p>Maybe not. I am aiming for being cross-platform so I won't make bindings of DirectX, but I'm not going to use OpenGL either because I just can't get hold of it; I will stick to the `racket/gui` package at least in the beginning.</p>
  
  <h3>For what is the "pt 0" in the title?</h3>
  This page serves as an index for other parts of this project. There will be more parts in the future, which I'll leave a link here.
