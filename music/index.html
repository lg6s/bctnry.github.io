                    <p>thought it'd be a good idea to make a website dedicated to music that i've heard throughout the years. so i made this.
                    <p>were it not be the case that it's too late to pursuit for getting accepted by a music college (and my family couldn't afford the tuition) i probably wouldn't sit here &amp; do cs stuff (probably will do coding in languages like processing, pure data, FAUST &amp; csound though). of course "it's never to late to get into music" you might say, but we have our own technical difficulties in china mainland so... yeah.
                    <p>i couldn't remember how long i've started listening music "seriously". maybe 9 or 10 yrs ago since my first acquaintance with the beatles (their stuff still sounds very good to me nowadays). i listen to a lot of different stuff now, "trying to appreciate the beauty behind different genres" as you might say. i've also been trying to make music since 2014, and no i'm not gonna publish them until i've got enough confidence for that. they sound really awful. don't know if all kids who are obessed with music (and those who think they are) have gone through a i-wanna-be-a-great-musician phase (or being in such a phase right now). i certainly have.
                    <p>and no i'm not saying that i've got superior taste when it comes to music (my taste might be bad for some of you). i thought it'll be interesting if i begin to talk about musicians &amp; their work in a casual way (i.e. no very serious theoretic stuff like harmonic analysis, no analysis on a specific sound used in some electronic music in order to mimic it with 3xOsc or something like that, no nothing), and at the same time i wanna share with you the stuff that i've found throughout the years. most of them are not very well-known; i thought they were good, you might think so, too. so it's somehow a pity, at least for me, to let them be forgotten.
