  <h3>Falsehoods. Falsehood never ends.</h3>

  
<p>2. The Gatsby Falsehood

<p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      some random highschool guy with a 16GB RAM Intel i5 notebook: 抱怨Intellij IDEA卡的人都好蠢，他们就不会关插件吗？
    </p>
    <p>
      me, an intellectual (who only have access to a 4GB RAM i3 notebook & for some specific technical difficulties have to do his Android course assignment in Intellij IDEA & have all Android unrelated plugins disabled but <i>still get heavy lags</i>): oh yeah how about you go f**k urself <b><i>you little moron</i></b>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</p>

  <p>3. The Orthogonality Falsehood


<blockquote>
A: improve JVM performance.<br />
B: use StringBuilder.<br />
A: IMPROVE JVM PERFORMANCE.<br />
B: USE StringBuilder.<br />
A: YEAH YOU LITTLE MORON CLEARLY DON'T KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO IMPROVE JVM PERFORMANCE ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS SUCH STUPID LITTLE THINGS
</blockquote>
  </p>

  <p>4. The I-Don't-Know-A-Thing-But-I'm-Better-Than-Professionals Falsehood
  <p>Example 1:
    <blockquote>
      (Music) arrangement &amp; orchestration involves wavelet transform.
    </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>Example 2:
    <blockquote>
      Art is dead, humanities too.<br />
      <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang the most powerful programming language in the world</a> comes to the rescue.<br />
      </blockquote>
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>5. The Stealth Sneer Falsehood
    <blockquote>
      some random guy: oh is that what you did...<i>*sneers*</i><br />
      me (thinking): <i>what did i do wrong</i><br/>
      some random guy: you're doing pretty good but it was just...<i>*sneers*</i><br />
      me (thinking): <i>wtf did i do wrong...????</i><br />
      some random guy 2: bro he does not know that just let him be himself...<i>*sneers*</i><br />
      me (thinking): oh yeah if those guys didn't want to tell me what i've done wrong or they knew absolutely nothing but just just tryna get me feel stupid &amp; guilty i'm gonna <b><i>beat the sh*t out of their f**king brains</i></b>.
    </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>6. The Resolving-to-Ages Falsehood
    <p>
    Example 1:
    <blockquote>
      <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/993">some random guy</a> <i>who have only worked in an assembly line before &amp; <b>never wrote a single line of code in the past of his life</b></i>: you're younger than me &amp; you disagree with my opinion, that means your understandings of programming makes no sense because you're just 17 yrs old.
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    Example 2:
    <blockquote>
      <a href="https://github.com/TKT2016">some random guy</a> <i>who believes that the language he "designed"</i><sup>[1]</sup><i> has the power of revolutionizing how people learn programming in some specific places</i><sup>[2]</sup>: I've worked as a programmer for 5 yrs &amp; you're just some stupid little brat out of nowhere so I have more expertise than you. Now get the f**k out of here.
    </blockquote>
    </p>
  </p>

  <p>7. The Self-Justification Falsehood
    <p>Example 1:
    <blockquote>
      some random guy who feels insulted &amp; rages over this article full of words of truth: SHUT UP YOU'RE JUST A NOOB WHO KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT PROGRAMMING OR ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY YOU CALL THOSE "FALSEHOODS" BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND YOU NEVER LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLE.
    </blockquote>
    </p>
  <p>Example 2:
    <blockquote>
      some other random guy who also feels insulted &amp; rages over this article full of words of truth (but tried to act calm &amp; mature): oh it's very childish of you to say such words stop being so childish
    </blockquote>
    
  </p>
  </p>

  <p>1. The most stupid falsehood which is so stupid that people who ever did this should have their seats reserved in hell<sup>[3]</sup>
    <blockquote>
      some philosopher guy: well i don't know about programming at all but in modern philosophy we have blahblahblahblah...<br />
      some random guy 0: oh... can understand. (clearly didn't understand a word)<br />
      some random guy 1: oh... is that...so... (clearly didn't understand a word as well but just being pretentious)<br />
      me: would you please be so kind to explain what is blahblahblah?<br />
      philosopher guy: blahblahblah is common sense. if you don't know what it is, you should just shut up and read more books. stop being a moron bugging around here.
    </blockquote>

  Now. Let's talk about my friend Bob<sub><del>the hand-drawn stickman</del></sub>:
  <ul>
    <li>He never talks so that <b><i>HE NEVER GETS HIMSELF INTO ANY OF YOUR STUPID ARGUMENTS</i></b>.</li>
  </ul>
  Bob is top-tier smart. <b>Be like Bob</b>.

    [0]: This webpage is not an April-fool joke.<br />
    [1]: It's basically just some pretty-degraded weird-ass looking clone of a tiny (very tiny) subset of C# in which programmers have to use some weird-ass formatted Chinese to write the code &amp; have to live with the ambiguity issues because the language uses some NLP tool to seperate tokens (imagine writing System.out.println as Systemoutprintln &amp; u r pretty close). It compiles to .NET CIL so he even didn't have to write his own GC or deal with OO dispatching issues and shit. Fun fact: while for a "language" like this the localization is (almost) the only thing that matters, he claimed that choosing the appropriate Chinese translation for the reserved keywords is <i>not important at all</i>.<br />
    [2]: Mainland China, specifically.<br />
    [3]: By the way that's why I still have some stupid prejudice when it comes to philosophy. To be honest, I really wish one day you (the philosopher guy) will die in the most miserable way possible.<br />
    [4]: I'm not being sarcastic. I'm not just being honest either. I'm being <i>extremely honest</i>.
