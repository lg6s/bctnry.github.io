<h1>Laravel note 1.</h1>Guess it'll be suitable for rewriting my crappy unfinished school project for a database course.
(No, it's not a toy database - that'll be impressive though. You probably wish it is.
I do, too. But it's not. It's just an PHP application that uses databases for stuff.)
<br /><h2>Setting up the environment</h2>Setting up the environment is pretty straight-forward.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Composer</b>: Follow the steps at <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">https://getcomposer.org/download/</a>, rename the file "<code>composer.phar</code>" to "<code>composer</code>" and put it under your <code>$PATH</code>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Laravel</b>: Follow the steps at <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation">https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<br />I've learned enough MVC stuff to know how to use one without knowing about the implementation details:
<ul>
<li>"Models" represent stuff. No special folder for storing "models" in laravel though, but will live with it somehow.</li><li>"Views" are your displaying templates.</li><li>"Controllers" are how you're gonna display your stuff / handle stuff from user input.</li><li>"Routes" are how you're gonna map URLs to different stuff.</li></ul>
