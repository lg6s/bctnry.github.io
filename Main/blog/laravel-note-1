h1: Laravel note 1.
Guess it'll be suitable for rewriting my crappy unfinished school project for a database course.
(No, it's not a toy database - that'll be impressive though. You probably wish it is.
I do, too. But it's not. It's just an PHP application that uses databases for stuff.)

h2: Setting up the environment
Setting up the environment is pretty straight-forward.
ul.
li.
|b|Composer|\: Follow the steps at |a[href="https://getcomposer.org/download/"]. https://getcomposer.org/download/|, rename the file "|code|composer.phar|" to "|code|composer|" and put it under your |code|$PATH|.
END[li].
li.
|b|Laravel|\: Follow the steps at |a[href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation"]. https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation|.
END[li].
END[ul].

I've learned enough MVC stuff to know how to use one without knowing about the implementation details:
ul.
li: "Models" represent stuff. No special folder for storing "models" in laravel though, but will live with it somehow.
li: "Views" are your displaying templates.
li: "Controllers" are how you're gonna display your stuff / handle stuff from user input.
li: "Routes" are how you're gonna map URLs to different stuff.
END[ul].
