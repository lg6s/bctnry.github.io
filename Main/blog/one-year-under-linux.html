                    On March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2017, I suddenly realized that since I've got my own computer I could do whatever I wanna do to it. I decided to replace Windows 10 with Arch Linux for one single reason: I wanna have full control of my hard drive. I don't know why, but Windows 10 had been chewing up way too much disk space with stuff that I never got the chance to know &amp; stuff that I wouldn't need anytime soon. I said to myself, that this is enough. It's time to escape.
