                  It seems like that we have already exhausted all the potential of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">12-TET system</a> that we have to publish even the most stupid songs. Only worth giving it a listen if its lyrics of sexual innuendo (the title "Dame Tu Cosita" means "Give me your little thing" literally) are actually intended to be an obscure reflection on child molestation.

                    2018.3.6 - AMBITIOUS LOVERS

                    <p>Ambitious Lovers remains being one of my favourite band of all time, and the longer the time that i've spent on simply listening to their music &amp; do nothing else the more of a pity the fact that they never took off have become to me. It was classified as a "dance-pop" band by Wikipedia. Don't believe it. Almost all of its best work sounds nothing like regular dance pop at all, and also they hardly sounds like anything i've heard at all. I really enjoy the ambient the "dark", pounding bass has created in "More Light" and "It's Gonna Rain"; the outro of "More Light" is especially good. But if it's for relaxation i'll recommend "EÃÅ Preciso Perdoar" &amp; "Lust".
                    <p>Favourite track: "More Light", "Lust", "It's Gonna Rain" from <i>Lust</i>; "It Only Has to Happen Once", "Privacy", "Too Far" from <i>Greed</i>; "Cross Your Legs", "Locus Coruleus", "My Competition" from <i>Envy</i>.

                    <p>thought it'd be a good idea to make a website dedicated to music that i've heard throughout the years. so i made this.
                    <p>were it not be the case that it's too late to pursuit for getting accepted by a music college (and my family couldn't afford the tuition) i probably wouldn't sit here &amp; do cs stuff (probably will do coding in languages like processing, pure data, FAUST &amp; csound though). of course "it's never to late to get into music" you might say, but we have our own technical difficulties in china mainland so... yeah.
                    <p>i couldn't remember how long i've started listening music "seriously". maybe 9 or 10 yrs ago since my first acquaintance with the beatles (their stuff still sounds very good to me nowadays). i listen to a lot of different stuff now, "trying to appreciate the beauty behind different genres" as you might say. i've also been trying to make music since 2014, and no i'm not gonna publish them until i've got enough confidence for that. they sound really awful. don't know if all kids who are obessed with music (and those who think they are) have gone through a i-wanna-be-a-great-musician phase (or being in such a phase right now). i certainly have.
                    <p>and i'm not saying that i've got superior taste when it comes to music (my taste might be bad for some of you). i thought it'll be interesting if i begin to talk about musicians &amp; their work in a casual way (i.e. no very serious theoretic stuff like harmonic analysis, no analysis on a specific sound used in some electronic music in order to mimic it with 3xOsc or something like that, no nothing), and at the same time i wanna share with you the stuff that i've found throughout the years. most of them are not very well-known; i thought they were good, you might think so, too. so it's somehow a pity, at least for me, to let them be forgotten.
                    <p><h4>how did you listen to that much music?? how did you buy all that albums &amp; singles &amp; stuff??</h4>
                    <p>the fact is i didn't buy any (except for those i could find in local music store). i live in a country where people can listen to tons of stuff for <em>free</em>. i know it's bad &amp; i should have pay for them but were it not be the case i wouldn't be who i am (when it comes to music) today: my mother did not listen to music, and all my father listen to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Cheung">Leslie Cheung</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_(band)">Beyond</a>.
                    <p><h4>so where are you at now?</h4>
                    <p>i'm currently obessed with jazz music, especially post-bop &amp; John Coltrane.
                    <p>thank goodness we have internet, or most kids like me will never get this far.
