    <h1>``Your English is actually not that poor at all...! But why..."</h1>
    <p>Some people have been wondering about why do Chinese say sorry for their English all the time. I certainly have no idea of what they're actually thinking when they apologize, yet I can tell you what I'm thinking to give you some idea... It's actually one of the Chinese way of dodging shame, because <strong>you can make mistakes freely if you stated that you're not capable of doing something in the first place</strong>, and Chinese of course, just like others, <strong>hate being shameful</strong>; so next time when they've made some grammatical error or misspelled a word, they are at ease because they are subject to be forgiven as long as they've stated that their English are not good.</p>
