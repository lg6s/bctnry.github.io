    <h1>The rules</h1>
    "The Game" or this game is a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)">this game</a>. The rules are as follows:<br /><br />
    <b>Rule 1</b>: Everybody in the world who knows about The Game is playing The Game.<br />
    <div class="note">So if:<br />
      1. It's the first time that you've heard of this game, or<br />
      2. You've opened <a href="thegame.html">this webpage</a> but you refused to learn about it (which is really smart) before,<br />
      visiting it didn't make you lose. It's currently one of the only two ways to keep yourself from losing.<br />
      (The other way is to declare your leaving explicitly.)<br /><br /></div>
    <b>Rule 2</b>: Whenever you thinks about The Game after your first oblivion about it, you lose.<br />
    <div class="note">So you didn't really lose it just now.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Rule 3</b>: Losses must be announced.<br />
      <div class="note">You can choose any method that is suitable for you.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Rule 4</b>: The game restarts automatically after you've forgotten about it.<br />
      <div class="note">So do not ask yourself questions like "when will the game starts again" as it will make you lose immediately.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Rule 5</b>: You can only quit the game by announcing that you quit.<br />
      <div class="note">Once you've announced that you have quitted from the game, rules above don't have any effect on you anymore.<br />
	That is, thinking about this game don't make you lose anymore.<br />
	in addition, when you quit, <strong>YOU HAD WON THE GAME</strong>.</div><br />
      <b>Rule 6</b>: You must announce your participation if you want to play the game again after quitting it.<br />
      <div class="note">It is regarded as a loss; so you need to follow Rule 3 immediately.</div><br />
      <div class="footnote">Now you have known the rules.<br />
      Click <a href="thegame.html">here</a> to go back, which won't make you lose the game if this is your first visit to the rules.
