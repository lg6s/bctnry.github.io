    <h3>about me.</h3>
    <p>I'm a student of computer science and information technology in <a href="http://www.gdufs.edu.cn">GDUFS</a> since September 2015. I'm interested in programming language theory, maths and theories of music. (of harmony, etc)</p>
    <p>Brad Contenary is not my real name ... I use the name  for most online activities. And maybe in real life, if I was required to provide an English name other than the pinyin of my Chinese name.</p>
    <p>Recently learning German on duolingo.com. Didn't pay much effort though. </p>
    <h3>about the site.</h3>
    <p>This page (and the pages that will be added here in the future) are hosted on github. <a href="http://rainfall.motd.org/">I have a blog on motd.org</a> previously so I am planning to put the essentials on here and keep a copy on the other place.</p>
    <p>The list of recently avaliable posts is <a href="posts.html">here</a></p>
    <p>This site do not use an automatic page generator - I write all the raw HTML&CSS code. At least by now.</p>
    <h3>about this name.</h3>
    <p>There's no family name as "Contenary", but I insisted on taking it when I came up with this letter combination about 3 years ago. The first name "Brad" is from a rock band. <br />The name has no special meanings.</p>
